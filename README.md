# LSM6DS3-Shield-Bluetooth
Hardware design files and instructions for a Arduino Pro Micro shield with a 6 axis accelerometer and gyroscope + female headers to attach an HC-05 module. 

Detailed description - I'd like a way to transmit Acceleration and Gyroscope data to the PC using bluetooth at the same time the pulseox is transmitting data over serial so I could look at both together. So, I'm using the HC-05 bluetooth module to transmit this data. The module connects to VCC, GND, TX and RX of the microcontroller. The HC-05 module itself is 3.3V, but has level conversion circuitry to accept 3.3V to 6V Vcc. As for the IC, I chose the LSM6DS3 because it is cheap, has 6DOF, a huuuge FIFO buffer, good libraries and circuit schematic I can base my design off of (Amazing souls at sparkfun). The LSM6DS3 communicates to the microcontroller through I2C and 3.3V logic. As bluetooth and the main chip were using 3.3V logic, it made sense to go with a 3.3V development board. I chose to use the Arduino Pro Mini (the 0.8mm version Sparkfun makes) with an atmega 328P. The whole thing can be powered by a 3.7V LiPo battery through a JST header. I managed to fit a 4 pin right angled header for the HC-05 module, the IMU and a JST header on the footprint of the pro mini to make a header.
